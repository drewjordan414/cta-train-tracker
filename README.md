# cta-train-tracker

## Description
-  CTA Train Tracker is equipped with a multitude of functions, including real-time train tracking, delay alerts, and data analysis features, which offer insights into the transit patterns, peak hours, and more. These tools offer users the opportunity to plan their commutes more effectively, avoid delays, and better understand the transit system's patterns. The application leverages the CTA Train Tracker API, which provides access to real-time train arrival estimates and location data. This enables the program to offer up-to-date and accurate train tracking capabilities. Open for improvements and new feature additions, this project welcomes contributions from other developers, promoting open-source collaboration and the continual enhancement of the tool.

## Comign Soon
1. Search bar to search for a specific train line
2. Ability to click on a train stop and see the next train times
3. Ability to click on a train stop and see the full route of the train line
4. Real time tracking of all trains currently running displayed on map

## Project Requirements
* You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. 
The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs. (You are allowed to use one learned in class, i.e. Day.js, OpenWeatherMap, Github API, etc.)
https://rapidapi.com/hub is a resource to discover API's you might want to use (Remember no OAuth)
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
